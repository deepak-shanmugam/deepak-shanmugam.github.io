        <h2>Thoughts on Simplicity</h2>
        <p>Nowadays I like things that are simple, minimalistic and straight forward. It saves lot of our time and gives us a distraction free environment. When the time goes, it will create a feeling of flatness and boring. It make us to move away from it and choose a different path. But after experiencing many paths and changes, ultimately it makes us to come back again with more awareness and then appreciate how much it has really helped everyone multi-dimensionally and unconditionally. That is the beauty of it. If you have noticed, this website is also trying to reflect that in a way. This doesn't mean that other paths are bad. Each serves its own purpose and we are independent to choose anything according to the needs. If you don't like being too simple, that is completely fine. I am just trying to be simple. I might not be simple as you think. Everything is just a process and its by-product! </p> 
        <p>I mostly use C Language for two reasons. One, as mentioned above it is very simple, minimalistic and straightforward with few syntax and keywords to remember. The second reason is there are very less abstraction most of time. As a result there is a lot of opportunity to understand how things work just because using this language. As it is very simple, we have to manually manage several resource for our program to run successfully without any errors. In order to do that, we have to be very careful on our implementation. That will happen only if you understand fundamentals of several things. If not, any kind of vulnerabilities can happen in your program. That is one of the basic difference between C and other programming language. One of the efficient things to do in C programming is to create libraries and then reuse it. </p>
