        <h2>Thoughts on Simplicity</h2>
        <p>Nowadays I like things that are very simple, minimalistic and straight forward. As it saves time and gives us a distraction free environment. But sometimes simple things create a feeling of boring and as a result that make us to look for some other alternatives. After trying all the new changes and alternatives finally it make us to return back to simplicity with much awareness. After that it will make us to realize how good simple things are and how helpful it is in various ways. That is the greatness of simplicity. If you have noticed, this website is also trying to reflect that in a way. I am trying the ways and methods to be simple. That doesn't mean that i am 100% a simplistic person. Everything is made up of a process and its result. Also this doesn't mean that other ways are irrelevant. Everything has its own purpose. we are independent to chose any according to the needs. If you don't like simplistic things, that is completely fine. </p> 
        <p>I mostly use C Language for two reasons. One, as mentioned above it is very simple, minimalistic and straightforward with few syntax and keywords to remember. The second reason is there are very less abstraction most of time. As a result there is a lot of opportunity to understand how things work just because using this language. As it is very simple, we have to manually manage several resource for our program to run successfully without any errors. In order to do that, we have to be very careful on our implementation. That will happen only if you understand fundamentals of several things. If not, any kind of vulnerabilities can happen in your program. That is one of the basic difference between C and other programming language. One of the efficient things to do in C programming is to create libraries and then reuse it. </p>
